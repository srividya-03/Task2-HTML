<h1 style="color:Gray;">Our Story</h1>

<img src="https://im1.dineout.co.in/images/uploads/restaurant/sharpen/1/b/n/p109340-1666171862634fc3d6a6afd.jpg?tr=tr:n-large" style="width:600px; height:400px;">

<h1 style="color:Gray;">Meet Glen Williams</h1>
<p>Glen Williams, the founder of Glen's Bakehouse, is quiet and intense with an unwavering commitment to creating culinary masterpieces.

His journey started four decades ago with Sweet Chariot which was one of the first bakeries dishing out sweet treats like Japanese cakes, Black Forest cakes, and Lemon Tarts just to name a few. Glen was the man behind Sweet Chariot's success and became a household name with over 35 outlets across Bangalore.
<br><br>
Glen has carefully crafted the Glen's Bakehouse offerings - whether it's a delicious cupcake, a refreshing sherbet, or rich, thick milkshake to an aromatic latte or a beautifully layered birthday cake, or a cheesy sourdough pizza from the signature firewood oven to deliriously delicious kinds of pasta to big juicy burgers to creamy pastries, Glen has ensured that every item is made from the best and freshest ingredients.
<br><br>
Even though Glen's Bakehouse has many branches in Bangalore, Mysore, and, now Chennai, Glen personally oversees quality and production to ensure that every customer experience has a delightful experience.
<br><br>
Glen Williams started his journey 40 years ago in 1981 and has been part of the success of not only Glen's Bakehouse but also Sweet Chariot and Toit.
